### Common Issues

| ----- | -------- |
| **My game won't launch!** | This is **not a bug**, do not report this here. Ask a support member in the RusherHack Discord. You can join the Discord by opening your installer and linking your Discord username and clicking the invite link. |
| **I have an issue when using `[rusher module]` with `[third-party module]`** | This is **not** officially supported. If you would expect these two modules to work together reasonably **or** is a major issue, please report it. If you are unsure, contact a support member. |
